The main purpose of the program is to support and development of long-term partnerships among industry, academe, and government. The  IUCRC Centers are catalyzed by an investment from the National Science Foundation and their growth and impact are primarily realized through partnerships from industry members, with NSF taking the supporting role in the development and evolution of the Center. Each Center is established to conduct pre-competitive industry relevant R&D in unique expertise areas for increased industry engagement and support, new business development opportunities, and research capabilities of the Center faculty. Overall, the IUCRC program contributes to the nation’s research infrastructure base and enhances intellectual capacity of the engineering and science workforce through the integration of research and education. As appropriate, an IUCRC uses international collaborations to advance these goals within the global context.</p>

                    <h1>Technical Scope</h1>
                    <p>The scope of the CAC center broadly encompasses cloud computing systems at every level, including applications development and the use of autonomic computing methods for the management of these systems. CAC activities on cloud computing cut across several layers of IT systems, including: hardware platforms for computing, storage and networking; design of data centers that aggregate platforms to provide cloud services; systems software and distributed computing middleware providing programming interfaces and management primitives within and across multiple cloud data centers; applications that leverage the on-demand and scalable nature of cloud platforms; and cyber-security.</p>
                    <p>The CAC's current activities focus on improving methods, architectures and technologies for the design, implementation, integration and evaluation of computing systems and applications, especially in ways that are capable of achieving desired behaviors without the involvement of users or administrators. As a forefront research center at the intersection of cloud computing and autonomic computing, the CAC aims to promote automated advanced self-management capabilities within and across the layers of cloud and advanced distributed computing systems and applications in order to enable independent operation, minimize cost and risk, accommodate complexity and reduce technological uncertainty, and enable development of systems of systems with large numbers of components.</p>

                <div id="goals">
                    <h1>Goals</h1>
                    <p>The primary goal of the CAC@TTU is to identify and foster industry-academia-government partnerships on topics directly related to emerging cloud infrastructures, software and standards, including issues related to security, performance, interoperability and workload portability across infrastructure boundaries. A related practical goal is to identify and develop coordinated efforts to organize, classify, and develop reference implementations and software that showcase the benefits of cloud and autonomic computing in areas of real-world applicability to business needs. Ranking equally with these is our goal to create a well-trained workforce through opportunities that relate the domain expertise of faculty and students to important problems and solutions in advanced distributed computing, cloud computing and autonomic computing that is capable of sustaining the activities and opportunities created through this joint effort.</p>
