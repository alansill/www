    <p class="info">The Industry Advisory Board (IAB) consists of designated representatives of the 
      <a href="current-members.html">center members</a>,
      which are the companies, non-NSF federal and/or state government agencies who have invested
      the annual fees for membership in the CAC. The IAB selects a chair and co-chair to conduct 
      the business of the center, which takes place at periodic teleconferences and at two designated
      semi-annual meetings of the entire center that are generally conducted in person at one of the
      CAC sites or at a convenient intermediate location. The IAB selects the research projects of the
      center as a whole, approves the budgets, approves and revises bylaws and policies, and is responsible 
      for coordinating work on all such topics with the assistance of the center and site directors listed 
      below, consistent with National Science Foundation (NSF) guidlines for its Industry/University
      Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC) program.</p>

              When asked about his most favourable experience, he replies that it is his current projects 
              at BPU Holdings. His focus is on artificial intelligence with the heart of it being 
              Natural Language sciences – recognition, processing and emulation. Carlos is devoted to building 
              models to identify, learn and even synthesize human emotion, known as Artificial Emotional Intelligence 
              (AEI). When Carlos is not working Seoul, he spends his time with family in Utah. He enjoys hiking 
              outdoors and restoring muscle cars and motorbikes as well.

      The CAC university site directors allow site research programs to be managed locally at each university, 
      facilitate reporting to NSF and communication with researchers and local university administration, and 
      coordinate with the center directors to carry out the research program selected by the IAB. The current 
      CAC primary and affiliate site directors and institutions are listed below. Primary sites have multi-year
      grants from NSF that cover the administrative costs of running the center at their universities, and can
      optionally sponsor affiliate sites that work with the CAC through their sites.

      primary site is responsible for sponsoring this affiliation, which is designed to extend the pool
      of researchers available to fulfill the goals of projects selected by the IAB. Affiliate sites
      can apply to become CAC primary sites when they reach the qualifications set by NSF for a fully
      sustaining set of industry memberships brought into the CAC by that site.
